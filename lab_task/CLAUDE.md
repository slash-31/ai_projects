# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a lab task tracking repository used to keep track of ongoing experiments, projects, and learning activities. The repository serves as a workspace for organizing and documenting lab work.

## Working in This Repository

When the user mentions "lab tasks" or similar concepts, they are referring to experimental work, learning projects, or technical investigations they want to track and document here.

This is a flexible workspace - be prepared to:
- Create project directories for new experiments
- Set up different technology stacks as needed
- Document findings and progress
- Organize multiple concurrent lab projects

Since this is a fresh workspace, always confirm with the user about:
- Project structure preferences
- Technology choices and dependencies
- Documentation format preferences
- Git initialization (if needed)
