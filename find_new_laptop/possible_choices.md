**Critical Challenge Identified:**
The laptop market has a significant gap when it comes to 15" devices with built-in cellular connectivity. Manufacturers predominantly offer LTE/5G options only in their ultra-portable 13-14" business lines (ThinkPad, Latitude, Elite). The 15" laptop segment is largely consumer-focused and lacks cellular connectivity options.

**Why this gap exists:**
- 15" laptops are marketed primarily to consumers and home users
- Cellular connectivity is primarily a business feature
- Business users prioritize portability (13-14") over larger screens
- Mobile professionals using cellular typically want lighter, more portable devices

**Processor Performance Note:**
All recommended Intel Core i7 processors (13th generation) offer similar performance:
- i7-1365U: 10 cores (2P+8E), up to 5.2 GHz boost
- i7-1355U: 10 cores (2P+8E), up to 5.0 GHz boost

These are slightly different approaches than your current Snapdragon X Elite, which uses ARM architecture. Intel's 13th gen offers excellent performance, though single-core speeds may not directly match the 3.4 GHz base of your Snapdragon chip due to different architectures.

## The 15" Screen Reality Check

Both Claude and Gemini identified the same market reality: **15" laptops with built-in cellular connectivity are essentially unavailable in the current market.**

**Why this limitation exists:**
- Cellular connectivity is a business/enterprise feature
- Business users prioritize portability (13-14" form factor)
- 15" laptops target consumers/home users who use WiFi
- Mobile professionals want lightweight devices for travel
- Manufacturers segment their product lines accordingly

**Your Options:**

**Option A: Accept 13.5-14" Display**
This is the recommended path. Modern 14" displays with high resolution (2.8K, QHD+) provide excellent screen real estate, often comparable to older 15" displays due to higher pixel density and better aspect ratios.

**Option B: External Display for Desk Work**
Use a 13.5-14" laptop with cellular for mobility, then connect to an external monitor when at desk. This is how many professionals work.

**Option C: Portable WiFi Hotspot**
Buy a 15" laptop without cellular (like Surface Laptop 5 15") and use a separate mobile hotspot device. This adds complexity but gives you the 15" screen.

**Option D: Wait for Market Changes**
The laptop market evolves slowly. A 15" business laptop with 5G may eventually appear, but there's no indication this is coming in 2025.

**Recommendation**: Choose Option A (14" with cellular). The productivity gain from built-in cellular far outweighs the 1" screen reduction, especially with modern high-resolution displays.
